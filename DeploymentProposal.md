## 3. Remaining Tasks Analysis

### 3.1. ⚠️ CRITICAL ALIGNMENT ISSUE [MEDIUM→HIGH]
#### CI/CD Workflow Branch Mismatch (NEEDS IMMEDIATE FIX)
- **Status:** ❌ MISALIGNED - **UPGRADED TO HIGH PRIORITY**
- **Issue:** `.github/workflows/railway-deploy.yml` still configured for `develop` branch
- **Impact:** Deployment workflow will not trigger correctly since Railway now deploys from `main`
- **Required Fix:** Update workflow to trigger on `main` branch pushes
- **Files to Modify:** `.github/workflows/railway-deploy.yml`
- **Risk Level:** HIGH - Will prevent automated deployments

### 3.2. ⚠️ INCOMPLETE CONFIGURATION [MEDIUM]
#### AWS Credentials Configuration
- **Status:** ❌ PLACEHOLDER VALUES
- **Missing:** Actual AWS S3 credentials for file upload functionality
- **Current:** Placeholder values in configuration guide
- **Impact:** File upload features will not work until real AWS credentials provided
- **Required Action:** Obtain and configure actual AWS S3 credentials

#### Build-Time Environment Validation
- **Status:** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Missing:** Environment validation in build process for early error detection
- **Impact:** Configuration errors may only be discovered at runtime
- **Priority:** MEDIUM - Good practice but not deployment blocking

### ✅ COMPLETED - Ready for Production
1. **✅ Branch Configuration:** `railway.toml` specifies `main` branch for production
2. **✅ Environment Variables:** Comprehensive Zod validation schema implemented and tested
3. **✅ Database Connectivity:** Health endpoint validates database connectivity with SELECT 1
4. **✅ Health Checks:** Enhanced endpoint with optimized 60s timeout
5. **✅ Production Values:** OPENROUTER_API_KEY, REDIS_URL, Sentry configuration set

### ⚠️ FINAL TASKS - Before Production Deployment
6. **❌ CI/CD Alignment:** Fix GitHub workflow to deploy from `main` branch (HIGH PRIORITY)
7. **❌ AWS Credentials:** Replace placeholder AWS credentials with actual values (MEDIUM)
8. **⚠️ Final Build Test:** Run `pnpm build` with production environment variables (RECOMMENDED)
