## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Immediate Deployment (Production Ready)
```bash
# 1. Merge deployment branch to main
git checkout main
git merge fix/complete-deployment-setup
git push origin main

# 2. Railway will automatically deploy from main branch
# Monitor: https://darvayaai-production.up.railway.app/api/health
```

### Expected Health Check Response
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "service": "ai-chatbot",
  "checks": {
    "database": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "message": "Database connection successful",
      "responseTime": 45
    }
  }
}
```
