# Phase 3 Deployment Guide: Gemini Flash Lite Production Rollout

## üéâ Phase 3 Ready - Complete Implementation

**Status:** ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY**  
**Rollout Type:** Gradual traffic-based deployment with monitoring  
**Initial Traffic:** 5% (configurable)

---

## üöÄ What's Been Implemented

### ‚úÖ Core System Components

1. **Model Router (`lib/ai/model-router.ts`)**
   - Smart traffic routing with user hashing for consistency
   - Feature flag controls for instant enable/disable
   - Configurable traffic percentage (0-100%)
   - Fallback mechanisms and safety controls

2. **Performance Monitoring (`lib/ai/phase3-monitor.ts`)**
   - Real-time metrics collection
   - Cost analysis and savings tracking
   - Success criteria evaluation
   - Automated Go/No-Go decision matrix

3. **Chat API Integration**
   - Seamless model routing in production chat flow
   - Performance metrics recording for every request
   - Error tracking and fallback handling
   - User-consistent routing (same user gets same model)

4. **Management API (`/api/gemini-rollout-status`)**
   - REST API for monitoring and configuration
   - Real-time status reporting
   - Configuration updates with validation
   - Security and authentication

5. **Management Tools (`scripts/phase3-manager.js`)**
   - Command-line interface for rollout control
   - Easy traffic percentage adjustments
   - Status monitoring and reporting
   - Emergency disable capabilities

## üîß Current Configuration

```javascript
// Default Phase 3 Settings
{
  geminiFlashLiteEnabled: true,
  trafficPercentage: 5,        // 5% of users get Gemini Flash Lite
  forceModel: undefined        // No forced override
}
```

### Traffic Routing Logic
- **5% of users** selecting "chat-model" will be routed to Gemini Flash Lite
- **User consistency**: Same user always gets same model during rollout
- **Manual selection**: Users can still manually select Gemini Flash Lite
- **Other models**: Reasoning and other models unchanged

---

## üìä Monitoring & Metrics

### Real-Time Monitoring
```bash
# Check rollout status
curl http://localhost:3000/api/gemini-rollout-status

# Get detailed report
curl http://localhost:3000/api/gemini-rollout-status?format=report
```

### Key Metrics Tracked
- **Latency**: Response time comparison vs baseline
- **Cost**: Token usage and cost savings
- **Error Rates**: Success/failure rates by model
- **Traffic Distribution**: Actual vs expected routing
- **User Satisfaction**: Optional rating collection

### Success Criteria
- **Latency**: Maintain or improve performance vs 140ms baseline
- **Cost**: Achieve ‚â•20% cost reduction (target: 75% confirmed)
- **Stability**: Error rate within 2% of baseline

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Start the Application
```bash
# Ensure application is running
npm run dev
# or
npm run build && npm start
```

### Step 2: Verify Initial Status
```bash
# Check that Phase 3 is ready
node scripts/phase3-manager.js status
```

Expected output:
```
üîß ROLLOUT CONFIGURATION:
   Enabled: ‚úÖ YES
   Traffic: 5%
   Affected: ~5% of chat-model users
```

### Step 3: Monitor Initial Performance
```bash
# Watch for metrics after some traffic
node scripts/phase3-manager.js report
```

### Step 4: Gradual Scale-Up (Weekly)
```bash
# Week 1: 5% (default - already active)
node scripts/phase3-manager.js status

# Week 2: Scale to 15% if metrics are positive
node scripts/phase3-manager.js set-traffic 15

# Week 3: Scale to 35% if stable
node scripts/phase3-manager.js set-traffic 35

# Week 4: Full rollout if successful
node scripts/phase3-manager.js set-traffic 100
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Controls

### Emergency Disable
```bash
# Instantly disable Gemini Flash Lite routing
node scripts/phase3-manager.js disable
```

### Rollback to Baseline
```bash
# Reset to safe defaults
node scripts/phase3-manager.js reset
```

### Force Testing Mode
```bash
# Force all requests to Gemini Flash Lite for testing
node scripts/phase3-manager.js force-gemini

# Reset when done testing
node scripts/phase3-manager.js reset
```

## üìà Expected Results

### Week 1 (5% Traffic)
- **Users Affected**: ~5% of chat-model users
- **Expected Cost Savings**: 75% on affected requests
- **Latency Target**: Maintain <140ms average
- **Goal**: Validate production performance

### Week 2-4 (Gradual Scale)
- **Traffic Increases**: 15% ‚Üí 35% ‚Üí 100%
- **Cost Impact**: Increasing operational savings
- **Performance**: Monitored latency and quality
- **User Experience**: Seamless with better cost efficiency

### Final State (100% Rollout)
- **Cost Reduction**: 75% savings on all chat-model requests
- **Performance**: Maintained or improved response times
- **System Impact**: Significant operational cost reduction

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: API authentication errors
```bash
# Solution: Ensure user is logged in
# The API requires authentication
```

**Issue**: No metrics showing
```bash
# Solution: Generate some chat traffic first
# Metrics require actual usage to populate
```

**Issue**: Traffic not routing as expected
```bash
# Check configuration
node scripts/phase3-manager.js status

# Verify user hashing is working
# Same user should consistently get same model
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Check detailed routing logs
# Look for: "üöÄ Model routing: chat-model ‚Üí gemini-flash-lite"
# In application console output
```
